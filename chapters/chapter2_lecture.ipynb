Most modern computers\n","  have multiple CPUs so that computer can do multiple things at a time. However,\n","  that kind of programming gets tricky quite fast, so in this course we will\n","  assume the computer has only one CPU.\n","- **RAM** (**Random Access Memory**), or **main memory**: the computers\n","  short-term memory. It stores the data and instructions that the CPU is\n","  currently using, and gets erased when the computer is turned off. We will\n","  assume that computers have a *lot* of RAM, and that it's very fast to\n","  read/write it.\n","- **Secondary Storage** e.g. hard drives, solid state drives (SSDs): the\n","  computers long-term memory that stores data and instructions that the CPU may\n","  need to use later. Typically this is organized as as files and folders\n","  (directories).\n","- **Input/Output (I/O) devices**: the computer's interface to the outside world.\n","  Examples include the keyboards, mice, monitors, the Internet, watches,\n","  speakers, joysticks, VR goggles, rings, etc. --- anything you could attach to\n","  a computer.  In this course, we will assume that a computer has a keyboard,\n","  monitor, and can display graphical output.\n","\n","A **computer program** is a set of instructions that tells the computer what do\n","with these components. What data should it put where, and when?"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Variables\n","\n","A **variable** is a name that refers to a value in main memory (RAM). \n","\n","At the lowest-level, RAM uses numeric addresses to identify locations. \n","\n","For instance, we could store the value 15 at address 0x1040 in RAM. To retrieve\n","that value later, we need to have remembered the address 0x1040. That's not so\n","easy for humans!\n","\n","So instead, high level programming languages like Python use **variables** to\n","refer to values in RAM. When you create a variable, the computer reserves a\n","location in RAM and binds the variable name to that address location. So you,\n","the programmer, never need to know the actual numeric address.\n","\n","> **Aside** In some applications it is useful to know the exact address of a\n","> variable, e.g. if you are dealing with special-purpose hardware it might be\n","> necessary to read/write a particular address location. Thats where languages\n","> like C, C++ and assembly come in. They easily give you access to the exact\n","> address of a variable, plus lots of other low-level details.\n","\n","So while addresses are *implemented* as, we will almost never think of that way.\n","We typically think of a variable as a label that you can attach to a value in\n","RAM.\n","\n","In Python, you create a variable by assigning it a value using the assignment\n","operator `=`:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["6.99\n"]}],"source":["cost = 6.99   # defines a variable called 'cost' and assigns it the value 6.99\n","print(cost)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["All assignment statements have this form:\n","\n","```python\n","var = expr\n","```\n","\n","`var` is the name of the variable, and it appears on the left-hand side of the\n","assignment operator `=`.
